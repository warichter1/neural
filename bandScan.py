Evpanding: Estimate Relaxation from Band Powers
Added Gamma and built out class: GetWaves to track 4 relaxation and Gamma waves
From muselsl examples
Repository: https://github.com/alexandrebarachant/muse-lsl

This example shows how to buffer, epoch, and transform EEG data from a single
electrode into values for each of the classic frequencies (e.g. alpha, beta, theta)
Furthermore, it shows how ratios of the band powers can be used to estimate
mental state for neurofeedback.

The neurofeedback protocols described here are inspired by
*Neurofeedback: A Comprehensive Review on System Design, Methodology and Clinical Applications* by Marzbani et. al
